== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. What are the plugin requirements?
A. The admin section requires Jquery and Jquery UI to be enabled. These libraries will be loaded from the Google CDN if not present, then initialized on the widget and shortcode admin pages.

Q. Why two different admin panels for the widget and the shortcode?
A. All settings for the widget and the shortcode are stored independently. The widget(best used in the sidebar) and the shortcode(best used on a page or post) can be designed differently, with different themes, size, icon order, etc.

Q. Can I add my own icons?
A. No, not at this time. Each icon theme is designed as a set of individual image sprites (All the icons are arranged in a grid as a single image). Icons are not available as individual files.

Q. How were the icons created?
A. All icons were designed in-house at iiRe Productions using high-resolution vector images. This method helps us to produce the highest quality images.

Q. How do I access all the icons?
A. The free version of this plugin has limited access to certain social networks. If you would like to receive a registration code to unlock these, please consider making a donation.

Q. Are there additional icon themes?
A. Yes, there are additional free theme available as downloadable zip file on http://iireproductions.com/web/website-development/wordpress-plugins/plugins-social-icons/

Q. How do I change the default links for each icon?
A. In the Widget or Shortcode Designer, just double-click the desired icon to display the title/link icon and enter the appropriate values.
