== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q. What are the plugin requirements?** 
A. The admin section requires jQuery and jQuery UI to be enabled. These libraries are usually included with your default Wordpress installation, then initialized on the widget and shortcode admin pages.

**Q. Why two different admin panels for the widget and the shortcode?** 
A. All settings for the widget and the shortcode are stored independently. The widget(best used in the sidebar) and the shortcode(best used on a page or post) can be designed differently, with different themes, size, icon order, etc.

**Q. Can I add my own icons?** 
A. Yes, you can create a "custom1" (up to 5 respectively) folder under the plugin themes directory. Each icon theme is designed as a set of individual image sprites (All the icons are arranged in a grid as a single image), so your "icon grid" must match the layout on one of the other themes. Icons are not available as individual files.

**Q. How do I access all the icons?** 
A. The free version of this plugin has limited access to certain social networks (see Supported Networks). If you would like to receive a registration code to unlock these, please consider making a donation or purchasing the full version.

**Q. Are there additional icon themes?** 
A. Yes, there are additional free theme available as downloadable zip files on http://iireproductions.com/web/website-development/wordpress-plugins/plugins-social-icons/plugins-iire-social-icons-free-themes/

**Q. How do I change the default links for each icon?** 
A. In the Widget or Shortcode Designer, just double-click the desired icon to display the title/link icon and enter the appropriate values.   

**Q. Why two differnt email icons?** 
A. The first email icon launches a pop up dialog w/ a form using JQuery UI. The second email icon uses the http://mailto: function and launches the visitor's email client, such as Outlook.
